## Process

This week was unbearably busy. Even with time blocking, events out of my control meant that even the best laid plans for time commitment went awry. I am one of two lead organizers for T9Hacks. This week, my partner got covid. Thus, I had to to all of the work organizing the hackathon.

On the bright side, after this weekend I won't need to worry about not having enough time as this weekend (17 Feb 2023) is the hackathon. I look forward to doubling down on researching for an answer to this ar/virtual problem.

### Three.js + AR.js

Long story short, even with the more granular control of Three.js, AR.js' need to append the camera on top of the html page, superceding any other element on the page still has the same issue as A-frame.
