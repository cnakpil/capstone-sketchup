# Week 2 - Focus on Dev for Static Position Demo

## Overview

### Team Members

- Gray Assi: UX Lead
- Celine Nakpil: Programming Lead

### Timeline

26 January 2023 - 01 February 2023

### MVP Functions

- [x] Make the cube in blender with the raised letters on the sides
- [ ] Swap the image tag to use letters instead of hiro tags
- [ ] Have the cube be persistent/exist on the screen independent of a qr code

### Stretch Goals

- [ ] Prototype the custom AR.js events for basic rotation between two faces
- [ ] Swap the blender cube into the current existing demo
- [ ] Figure out how to hide the live camera feed, either by covering it with another layer or removing it completely
- [ ] Track multiple tags on the camera at the same time

## Process

### Learning Blender

Put myself through a quick crash course in Blender to learn enough to make a 3D cube with embossed sides, matching to the paper cutout cube that Gray made. I actually really love the controls for Blender! Super intuitive once I got the hang of the hotkeys.

Then, I figured out how to make a quick rotation animation for documentation and also general Blender knowledge purposes.
